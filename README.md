## Marriott Bonvoy's Homes & Villas Project (with Publicis Sapient)
- Project based on Marriott Bonvoy's Homes & Villas homestay rental website with consulting by Publicis Sapient.
- As a part of the Global Tech Experience: Web Development & Coding course, base code was given to us students as a template for completing the project.
- Base code is forked as a website clone of Homes & Villas.
- INSTRUCTIONS.md includes a general introduction to the project as well as the tasks outlined for completion by myself.
- marketUsersPrototype.md includes some market research and product framework/prototyping outlining ideas for new features in Homes & Villas
- Used Mapbox's global map API to implement map
- Code was originally done and completed on Repl then moved to GitHub
- Tasks were all completed in the script.js folder using JavaScript
- Also used knowledge of DOM manipulation of HTML structure and CSS styling for successful completion
- This was a very fun project to work on and I was excited with the results :)
