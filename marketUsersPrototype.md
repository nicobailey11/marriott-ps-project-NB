## Understand Your Market
*Provide links to the 3 websites you explored* 

Airbnb: https://www.airbnb.com/?c=.pi0.pk36239956_25650614176&c=.pi0.pk36239956_25650614176&ghost=true&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiApOyqBhDlARIsAGfnyMq-gCOvqm4w88Mc214w_McBpqubKEE6fGkS9E-jOBNETrHwNo7MqU4aAjr7EALw_wcB

VRBO: https://www.vrbo.com/

KAYAK: https://www.kayak.com/

*Briefly explain why these websites are a relevant comparison* 
- Airbnb compares to Marriot Homes & Villas by having a simple row-based card display but having more detailed elements on each card including rating, available dates to rent, and price per night. Marriot is more streamlined showing each card as a location (ex. Nashville,Tenessee) instead of a specific home which when clicked brings users to homes in that location. Airbnb's home screen has much more detail which honestly could be a bit overwhelming for a user.
- VRBO is similar to Homes & Villas through having a prominent hero section with an image and a big search bar, making searching for a home in a location much easier from the get go. Nav bar is similar with Trip Board (Saved Homes) and My Trips. Also, it has suggested destinations similar to Marriot's Recommended for You section. Main thing it shares is a simple layout that is clean and easy for users to see.
- KAYAK also includes a hero section featuring a large search bar with location, dates of stay, and also number of guests. KAYAK's navbar is vertical and left justified including similar elements such as Trips (My Trips) and a Sign In icon. It first displays Stays Near You instead of a recommended section of locations for users. Just like Airbnb, there is a lot more added to the home screen for stays than Homes & Villas which can again make things overwhelming for users.


*List at least 10 product features*
1. Guest favorite (Airbnb): shows the most favorited stays according to past guests' reviews and displays it as a badge at the top of each card
2. Rating distribution chart and display (Airbnb): new feature that shows the spread of ratings from 1-5 as overall and displays average ratings for different categories such as cleanliness and check-in
3. Easy sort of reviews (Airbnb): displays options based on recency, highest rated, lowest rated etc. to give users a more efficient process of reading reviews
4. Icon navbar of curated stays (Airbnb): small navbar with icons and titles of each curated collection of homes based on type of activity, trending, and type of building 
5. "Get inspired for a family trip" section (VRBO): gives a very visual way to look into collections based on different trip ideas using cards with family vacation images and a small description subheading of the list
6. Navbar search bar (VRBO/KAYAK): is fixed to page, moving as user scrolls to help ease of use
7. OneKey rewards program (VRBO): allows for only one account across various travel websites such as Expedia and Hotels.com, earning OneKeyCash and using rewards to book hotels, stays, and car rentals, and having different tiers with new perks including free room upgrades for VIP Access properties
8. Intro row of features (KAYAK): at the top of the page it has displayed a row of positive features that attract users with a simple description of each on a separate card that right on a website click gives customers a brief decription of what they provide
9. Price tracking (KAYAK): when looking for a rental, a user can set price alerts to notify customers when prices drop/increase on a saved rental
10. Best Time to Travel tool (KAYAK): feature uses data on your original location, destination, and length of trip to give users options on when to travel and when to book at a good price 


## Understand Your Users
*Write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing the themes that emerged from the user research*

The user research, both quantitative and qualitative, suggests that majority of users do not know what destination they want to go to and hope that the application/website they use makes their decision easy to get at with guiding the user through a wide variety of available options. Users would like a broad description of the popular destinations for each, claryifing and giving a reason for why they are picked as popular. On the destinations section, users would prefer a map with general regions of the world and a showcase of some homes, showing some some details about the region including climate, activities, landmarks and more. Sometime giving users a list of every single region and state of a country can be overwhelming and inefficient when not knowing a destination. A main theme to improve on is in giving just the right amount of detail of regions while giving broad categories based on types of activities, landmarks, views etc.


## Define and Prototype
REQUIRED:
- A popup on the homepage with 3 buttons
- The “recommended for you” cards populating in response to user input
- The destinations drop-down menu (top nav) populating in response to user input
- The map section reacting to BOTH a destination card click AND a - destination drop-down menu option click
- An image of the destination showing above the pin on the map section when the pin is clicked
